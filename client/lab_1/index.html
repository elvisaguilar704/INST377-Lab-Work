        <h1>Elvis Aguilar Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Describe your top 5 favourite albums.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My first album is YHLQMDLG from Bad Bunny and I like it because it is peak reggaeton.</li>
            <li>The Sun's Tirade from Isaiah Rashad is the perfect type of rap that I enjoy listening to on any given day.</li>
            <li>Graduation from Kanye west is my favorite album of his and it is hard to chose from a bunch of old classics, but songs 
                like Homecoming make me like this album so much more. </li>
            <li>2014 Forest Hills Drive from J. Cole is a classic and is the album that ensured me of his greatness as an artist.</li>
            <li>Malibu from Anderson .Paak is an album I cannot get over, his combination of singing and rapping while also
                 having R&B/Soul melodies is stunning.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em>.</p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br/>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br/>
        Add a hard line under here, and break the previous two lines using a soft line break. <hr/>
        </p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
        <p><img src='images/mochi.gif' alt='mochi.gif'/>
            <img src='images/mochi.jpg' alt='mochi.jpg'/>
            <img src='images/mochi.png' alt='mochi.png'/>
            <img src='images/mochi.svg' alt='mochi.svg'/> <hr/>
        </p>

        <p><a href='https://github.com/elvisaguilar704/INST377-Lab-Work'>Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.</a></p>
        <p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
